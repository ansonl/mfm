# 3D G-code Map Feature Modifier (MFM)

Add colored [isolines (contour lines/elevation lines)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line) and recolor [elevation ranges](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/map/styles-and-symbols/working-with-color-ramps.htm) to [3D printable map models](https://ansonliu.com/maps/). **3D G-code Map Feature Modifier (MFM)** is a G-code Post Processor made for 3D topo map models but any 3D model can be recolored with 2 additional colors.

**Use the latest version of MFM in 1 of the following 3 ways → [Getting Started](#getting-started)**

- [MFM App](https://github.com/ansonl/mfm/releases) - Easiest to use and get started with a graphical user interface. Supports G-code and Plate Sliced 3MF (G-code embedded 3MF). Precompiled for Windows/Linux/Mac
- [Integrated Post Processing Script in PrusaSlicer/Bambu Studio/Orca Slicer](https://github.com/ansonl/mfm/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) - Runs automatically after slicing. Supports G-code.
- [Python Script](https://github.com/ansonl/mfm/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) - Runnable from command line. Supports G-code.

**MFM adds additional features to the model by post processing sliced [3D printer G-code](https://marlinfw.org/meta/gcode/). 3D models and printing g-code can be recolored at either layer or individual feature/line level granularity.**

- **Feature/Line Type Scoping** - Recoloring can be set to only affect specific printing feature/line types. *Recolor only the top surfaces or walls at certain heights with MFM!*

- **G-code Feature Print Order Optimization** - Printed features are rearranged for faster, more consistent prints. Nozzle pressure is maintained and the number of toolchanges is minimized.

- **Wipe/Coasting Compensation** - Existing Wipe/Coasting flow compensation generated by the slicer is retained even when g-code features are relocated. MFM has a customizable flush volume based on the color used and can do a **Long retraction after cut** to reduce filament waste.

- **Prime Tower Aware** - Existing Prime Towers are reused for optimal filament flow and color flushing. *No prime tower or large prime tower? Both configurations are supported.*

- **Slicer Compatibility** - Tested to be compatible with PrusaSlicer, Bambu Studio, and OrcaSlicer. Supports G-code and Plate Sliced 3MF.

- **G-code Gadgets** - MFM's G-code parser has an advantage over other post-processers because it organizes existing G-code features into reusable segments similar to [gadgets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGX7odA87k&t=1868s) which are rearranged and chained for printing efficiency.

## Current G-code flavors supported

- Marlin 2 ([PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer)/[Bambu Studio](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio)/[Orca Slicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer))

> Your slicer **must generate g-code with [Relative Extrusion](https://www.ideamaker.io/dictionaryDetail.html?name=Relative%20Extrusion&category_name=Printer%20Settings)**. PrusaSlicer, Bambu Studio, and Orca Slicer default to relative extrusion. Cura defaults to absolute extrusion and relative extrusion must be explicitly enabled.

| Slicer | Tested Version |
| --- | --- |
| PrusaSlicer | 2.7.1 |
| Bambu Studio | 1.8.2.56 |
| Orca Slicer | 2.2.0 |
| Cura | N/A |

If you would like support for your printer or slicer G-code flavor to be added, please open an issue and test the G-code on your printer.

## Getting Started

Set up your slicer and printer for MFM by following the steps on each page below:

1. [Slicer Setup](slicer-setup.md)

2. [MFM Command Setup](terminal-setup.md) ***(Post Processing and Command Line only)***

3. [Minimal Toolchange G-code](minimal-toolchange-gcode.md)

4. [MFM Config Options](mfm-configuration-options-setup.md)

5. [MFM Usage and Printer Setup](printer-setup.md)

## Running MFM Post-processor

After doing ALL above setup steps, you can run MFM as a Slicer Post-processor Script/Python Script or Graphical App:

![MFM 3D map model app](./assets/icon.svg)

### Graphical App (GUI)

Download the [latest GUI release of MFM](https://github.com/ansonl/mfm/releases) and run `MFM.exe` to start MFM.

1. Select the [import Plate Sliced 3MF or G-code](./slicer-setup.md) that was exported from your slicer

2. Select the [MFM Options JSON](./mfm-configuration-options-setup.md) for your model.

3. Select the [toolchange G-code](./minimal-toolchange-gcode.md) for your printer.

4. Check if the exported 3MF or G-code file location looks right

5. Press **Post Process**

> If a release of MFM has not been built for your OS, you can launch the GUI by [downloading the code](https://github.com/ansonl/mfm/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), navigate to the code folder in the command line and run `python src/gui.py`.

### Slicer Post-processor Script or Python Script in Command Line

1. Add `mfm_cmd.py` command with the [listed parameters](terminal-setup.md) to slicer **Post-processing Scripts** setting.

2. **Slice** your model.

3. **Export Plate Sliced 3MF/G-code file** under the Print button in the upper right or File menu.

> If you update the MFM Options file, you may need to add/delete a space at the end of the slicer **Post-processing Scripts** setting to get the slicer to allow reslicing.

> ⚠️ **Known bug: The first color change may be set to the wrong color.** If the first color change is incorrect, open the G-code in a text editor and search for `TX` (e.g. `T3`) where `X` is the wrong color index and **replace the first match of `T3` with `T0`** or desired base starting color index. This issue randomly occurs ~50% of the time due to a known 10+ year old Windows Python [bug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15934950/python-file-tell-giving-strange-numbers).

### Printing Your Processed 3MF/G-code

#### Plate Sliced 3MF

Open the processed 3MF in your slicer and **Send/Print** to your printer.

#### G-code

Place the processed G-code file an SD card and put the SD card in your 3D printer or transfer the G-code file to your printer over a network.

See [Printer Setup](./printer-setup.md) for more options and important set up steps.

## Frequently Asked Questions

| Question | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| How do I convert a 3D model into G-code for printing? | After importing and slicing your model in a slicer software, export the 3D printer commands as [ASCII] G-code. MFM can be process and recolor this saved G-code file. |
| MFM did not add or change any colors. | Setup your slicer for MFM through [Slicer Setup](slicer-setup.md) |
| How can MFM recoloring be customized? | Read [Options](mfm-configuration-options-setup.md) for details. |
| How can MFM be used with a material other than PLA and customized toolchange? | See [Minimal Toolchange G-code](minimal-toolchange-gcode.md) on recommendations on how to setup your own toolchange. I may add an option to set toolchange temperatures based on material in the future. Open an issue with your use cases. |
| Incorrect color was printed even though previewing the exported G-code in the slicer shows the correct color slots being used. | Assign a different filament to each slot in the Bambu AMS. Every slot with a different color **must have a different color assigned** in AMS. Otherwise Bambu AMS [Autoswitch](https://forum.bambulab.com/t/automatic-material-switch-over/4189) feature may try to use a single slot's filament for a shared material and color between multiple slots. |
| Mixed OS line endings in the same file will lead to G-code errors. MFM tries to auto detect the line ending used with first line ending found. | Select the correct line ending of your G-code instead of auto detect. Either convert the entire G-code file with Unix line endings to Windows line endings before post processing or generate the G-code on Windows. [Python on Windows does not handle Unix line endings correctly.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15934950/python-file-tell-giving-strange-numbers) |
| Only one isoline interval and/or colored elevation range can be set. | Only one of each is exposed at the moment. The implementation could support more in the future if there is a use case. |
| Support and Bridge features are not explicitly prioritized to pprint first.  | I could prioritize printing certain features first in the future. Open an issue with your use cases for this. |

## Bug Reports

Open an issue on Github. Please note the OS, Slicer, printer, and provide the 3D model, MFM Options JSON, toolchange G-code, and logs. 

Logs are written to your home directory `~` in the files `mfm-script.log` and `mfm-script-stderr.log`.
