# Printer Setup for MFM

## Material Auto Refill

### Bambu printers

**AMS screen must be set such that each slot shows a different material type or color**. Bambu printers will try to substitute slots with similar material and a toolchange between slots with the same material and color set may be ignored. 

> The actual physical material and colors loaded do not need to be different or accurately reflected in the printer screen or slicer Device tab. Only the material/color shown on the printer or Device tab need to be distinct from each other.

**Auto Refill should be turned off.**
